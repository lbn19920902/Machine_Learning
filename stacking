# in stacking, the combining mechanism is that the output of the classifiers will be used as training data for another classifier
to approximate the same target function. basically, you let the level 1 classifier to figure out the combining mechanism
#stacked Generalization
1.split the training set into two disjoint sets
2.train several base learners on the first part
3.test the base learners on the second part
4.using the prediction from 3 as the inputs, and the correct resposes as the outputs, train a higher level learner
// what does train a higher level learner mean then? like validate set?
